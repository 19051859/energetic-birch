As a traveler, I always thought twice before renting any car while on vacation. So, I can understand the pain and disappointment we will got will renting the car in holiday session, encouraged me to derive a next-generation Solution which will help the traveler to rent any car upfront and even can rent their car to make money while on vacation mode. This cool idea makes me so passionate that I can work day and night to turn this solution into real-world software. Being a software engineer, I can think of this idea is realistic possible to develop a seed of the business and then I can engage more passionate agile engineers to make it as developed business.
